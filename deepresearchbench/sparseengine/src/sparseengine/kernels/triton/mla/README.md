# MLA Triton kernels

This directory contains the minimal LightLLM-derived mathematical kernels used
by SparseEngine's GLM-4.7 MLA path. It deliberately has no dependency on the
LightLLM Python package or runtime.

| Local file | Upstream file | Local changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `decode_stage1.py` | `lightllm/common/basemodel/triton_kernel/mla_att/decode_att/gqa_flash_decoding_stage1.py` | Removed device probing and runtime state; caller supplies strides, workspace, and static launch values; restricted shapes to GLM's 512+64 latent layout. |
| `decode_stage2.py` | `lightllm/common/basemodel/triton_kernel/mla_att/decode_att/gqa_flash_decoding_stage2.py` | Removed runtime imports; caller supplies schedule/workspace; added zero-context padded-row behavior. |
| `decode_schedule.py` | `lightllm/common/basemodel/triton_kernel/mla_att/decode_att/gqa_flash_decoding.py` | Rewritten around immutable config and caller-owned workspace; removed `infer_state`, global tuning, device inspection, and forward allocation. |
| `copy_latent.py` | `lightllm/common/basemodel/triton_kernel/kv_copy/mla_copy_kv.py` | Added `slot_mapping < 0` padding mask, bounds protection, layout checks, and opt-in-once slot validation. |
| `gather_latent.py` | `lightllm/models/deepseek2/triton_kernel/sample_kv.py` | Replaced modulo sampling with a padding-safe, ragged, request-indirected full-history gather into explicit packed outputs. |

## Contract

- Query latent: `[batch, local_heads, 512]`, BF16.
- Query RoPE: `[batch, local_heads, 64]`, BF16.
- Persistent caches: `[slots, 1, 512]` and `[slots, 1, 64]`, BF16.
- Slot/request/context metadata: INT32 CUDA tensors.
- Decode scale: `256 ** -0.5`, matching the pre-absorption GLM QK head
  dimension.
- Decode workspaces and outputs are allocated by the caller. The run path does
  not inspect device properties or allocate tensors.

`DEFAULT_GLM_MLA_DECODE_CONFIG` is a conservative correctness configuration
for the initial H100 implementation. It is not recorded as tuned until the
target GLM shape has dedicated benchmark evidence.

Production Triton binding prepares an SM-driven schedule, without a device-name
profile. Query heads use the next power-of-two tile capped at 16. The target
split count per request is `ceil(SM_count / ceil(local_heads / head_tile))`;
stage1 launches `4 * SM_count` persistent CTAs. Batch is not a grid axis: each
CTA traverses requests. The schedule therefore targets per-request parallelism,
not `batch * heads * splits` independent CTAs. These are performance heuristics,
not a cross-GPU optimality guarantee or provider-eligibility restriction.

At each replay, the GPU chooses a common block length from the sum of actual
lengths divided by `nonempty_rows * target_splits`, rounded up to `block_n`.
Per-request effective splits may differ for ragged input; padding does not
increase the target. Workspace capacity covers `max_batch * (target_splits+1)`
blocks, including ceiling-rounding slack. Launch shape, compiled variant and
addresses stay fixed across replay lengths. Explicit fixed configs retain the
legacy `program_count * blocks_per_program` target for controlled ablations.
The split workspace now grows with configured maximum batch size, trading
memory for parallelism; this is not a memory-neutral retuning. For example,
H100/H20 at max batch64 reserves4288 blocks (about168MiB of partial outputs),
versus2176 blocks in the old profile-wide workspace envelope. Account for this
allocation before KV capacity planning.

Synchronous slot-value validation is exposed separately so the cache manager
can validate a mapping once and reuse it across layers. Kernel calls remain
bounds-safe; passing `validate_slots=False` or `validate_metadata=False` means
the owning runtime boundary has already established the corresponding value
invariants.
